title: "Rogers Cup: Field Set (Women's)"

Serena Williams is obviously the favorite at 67%, but she actually faces a
fairly tough draw in Toronto, as she will likely face Dominika Cibulkova in the
quarterfinals.  Serena has never lost to Cibulkova, but with how Cibulkova has
improved over the past year and a half, I now give her a 17% chance at a
victory.  Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber headline the bottom half of the
draw.
