title: Wimbledon postmortem
---

I estimated Novak Djokovic's chances of winning Wimbledon at 83%.  That
certainly *seemed* too high, but then again, Djokovic had won 5 out of the last
6 majors (83%), so perhaps the estimate was justified.  Still, Djokovic lost in
a shocker to Sam Querrey, the first time Djokovic had failed to make the
quarterfinals of a grand slam since 2009.  Unsurprisingly, Querrey makes the
biggest move up in the ratings, while Djokovic makes the biggest move down.
Others making big moves up in the estimates are Andy Murray and Milos Raonic;
Raonic in particular has now overtaken Federer, although it's very close (this
seems fair after watching them play a fantastic 5-set match at Wimbledon).
Interestingly, if the tournament were to be re-played now with the current
estimates, the model predicts Djokovic and Murray each would have a 46% chance
of winning the tournament.

On the women's side, Serena Williams took home her 22nd grand slam title and of
course moves up a bit, as does Angelique Kerber, who played some brilliant
tennis in a losing effort against Williams in the final, but some more
interesting movers include Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (who reached the quarters
before losing to Serena), Ekaterina Makarova (who defeated Petra Kvitova and
Barbora Strycova before losing in three sets to Elena Vesnina in the round of
16), Yaroslava Shvedova (who reached the quarterfinals), and Venus Williams.
