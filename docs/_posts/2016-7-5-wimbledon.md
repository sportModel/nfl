title: Djokovic's departure shakes up the field
---

Sam Querrey's *really* surprising upset of Novak Djokovic (0.2% probability)
really opens up the field on the Men's side, particularly for Andy Murray, who
now becomes the clear favorite.  I don't think too many people were predicting a
Berdych-Pouille quarterfinal.

Checking in with some of the players I was curious about at the beginning of the
tournament:

* Nick Kyrgios: Won his first three matches (albeit not easily), but got demolished against Andy Murray
* Milos Raonic: Looking real good -- won his first three matches in straight sets, but pushed to 5 against Goffin in the round of 16.
* Alexander Zverev: Coasted in the first round, tough five-setter against Youzhny, and then upset by Berdych (Berdych is the higher seed, but I gave Zverev a 69% chance of victory.
* Dominic Thiem: Tough loss in the second round to Jiri Vesely, all three sets decided by tiebreaker.
