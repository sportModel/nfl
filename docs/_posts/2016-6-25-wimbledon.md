title: Wimbledon field set
---

Unsurprisingly, Djokovic is the huge favorite.  Djokovic has been on perhaps the
greatest run in the history of tennis over the past year, but still, 83% seems
surprisingly high.  Intuitively, I would think the probability is closer to 65%,
but time will tell.  Murray also has an excellent shot, with Federer's chances a
bit more distant due to the likelihood that he would have to beat both Djokovic
and Murray en route to a title.

Nick Kyrgios, one of the hottest players in tennis right now, is currently
ranked #4 on grass and is a dark horse to make some noise at this tournament.
Unfortunately for him, he's likely to face Andy Murray in the third round
(unfortunate for Murray too).  Other players who have gotten much better over
the past year and may surprise some people are Milos Raonic (the
fourth-most-likely to win the tournament), Alexander Zverev, and Dominic Thiem
(although grass is not Thiem's surface).  In an interesting second-round match,
Zverev is likely to face Mikhail Youzhny.  The 34-year-old Youzhny has clawed
his way back from a disastrous 2015 that saw his ranking plummet into the 100s,
and is once again relevant.
