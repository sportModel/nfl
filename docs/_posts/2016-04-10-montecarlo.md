title:  Monte Carlo field set
---

The clay court season rolls out in earnest this week with the Monte Carlo
Masters event.  Djokovic is the favorite, obviously, with about a 50% chance of
winning.  The rest of the field is about an even split between Murray, Federer,
and Nadal, with Djokovic/Federer in one half and Murray/Nadal in the other.

The number one storyline going into the clay court season this year is probably
whether Rafael Nadal can return to top form after failing to win a single major
tournament last year.  Currently, our approach estimates that he is still a
legitimate member of the Big Four on clay, but not on any other surface, and
even on clay would only be a 50-50 proposition against Federer (that feels weird
to write).  Let's see if he rebounds.
