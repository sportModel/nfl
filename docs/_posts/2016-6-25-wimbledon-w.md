title: "Wimbledon: Women's field"
---

With Victoria Azarenka injured and Maria Sharapova suspended, Serena Williams
has no obvious rival in the Wimbledon field.  Still, her chances of winning are
just 41%, with lots of players around the 5% level.  This seems to accord with
the last three grand slams, all of which Serena Williams has lost to different
players.

Will this be Madison Keys's breakthrough tournament?  According to the model,
she has a decent shot at a deep run and not too bad a chance to win it all.
Other players to watch out for include Barbora Strycova (who finished runner-up
to Keys at Birmingham, the major warm-up to Wimbledon on the Women's side),
Dominika Cibulkova (who won Eastbourne, the other big warm-up), and Elena
Vesnina, who won Eastbourne a few years ago and appears to be playing at that
level again.
