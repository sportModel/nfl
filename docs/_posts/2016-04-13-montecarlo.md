title: "Huge upset: Vesely over Djokovic"
---

With a pre-match win probability of 98.7%, this is one of the biggest upsets in
recent memory on the men's side.  Jiri Vesely's shocking victory over Novak
Djokovic really opens up the field, with 7 players now having at least a 5%
chance at the title.  Vesely is not among them, although I don't update the
model mid-tournament, and I expect the 21-year-old's estimates will jump quite a
bit after this victory.
