title: Feder on quest for title #8
---

OK, so Federer didn't have to face Djokovic, but he had clearly the toughest
path to win the tournament starting from the quarters, likely having to beat
Cilic, Raonic, and Murray to win his 8th title and break his current tie with
Sampras for the most Wimbledon titles in the open era.  Well, after an epic come
from behind victory against Cilic, rallying from 2 sets down, he's still got his
work cut out for him.  Raonic-Feder should be *good*.
