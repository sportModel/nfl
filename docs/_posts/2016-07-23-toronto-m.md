title: "Rogers Cup: Field Set (Men's)"

With Andy Murray, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Jo-Wilfred Tsonga all sitting
this one out, Novak Djokovic is the overwhelming favorite, with a 66% chance of
victory.  A lot of eyes will be on Milos Raonic as his main competition, with
Raonic staking a claim to replace Nadal as a member of the big four.  The two
would meet in the semis if they both advance that far.  The open field also
opens up a lot of doors for Nick Kyrgios, who is in the other half of the draw
and has a reasonable chance to advance to the finals, although Kei Nishikori
would have to be considered the favorite in the bottom half.
