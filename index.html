  <p>Predictions are available for the 2016 NFL season, as well as parameter estimates for each team's points scored and allowed, adjusting for opponent. The predictions are generated by a Bayesian model that assumes a t-distribution for the two scores in a football game.  The t-distribution (25 df), which has slightly wider tails than a Gaussian, is more robust to outliers (i.e., blowouts).  The degrees of freedom were chosen empirically in accordance with data from past years.</p>

  <p>Predictions are given for all weeks of the season based on the available data at that time. The most recent predictions for a given week are kept posted so that they may be looked back on and judged. For example, the predictions for Week 6 keep changing every week until we obtain Week 5 data, after which it remains as the prediction for Week 6 given data from Weeks 1-5 (and prior seasons).</p>
